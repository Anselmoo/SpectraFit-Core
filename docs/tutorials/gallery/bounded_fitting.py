"""Bounded fitting with an active-bounds solver (``"trf"``).

A physical bound like "amplitude cannot be negative" is only interesting
when it is likely to be *active* — a small, noisy peak whose unconstrained
least-squares optimum would otherwise land slightly negative. Plain
``"lm"`` is the fastest general-purpose solver, but [Choosing a
Solver](../../how-to/choosing-a-solver.md) recommends ``"trf"`` (Trust
Region Reflective) whenever "bounds are frequently active": ``"trf"`` adds
Coleman–Li bound scaling that shrinks trust-region steps as a parameter
approaches an active bound, on top of the reflective-bounds projection that
every LM-family solver in this codebase already shares (so ``"lm"`` alone
is never bound-*violating* — reflection alone keeps every LM-family result
inside ``[min, max]``, ``"trf"`` just approaches the wall differently).

This is a different question from :doc:`varpro_vs_lm`, which compares
solvers on an *unconstrained* separable problem. This example is solver
choice under *active* bound constraints.
