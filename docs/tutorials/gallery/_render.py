"""Pre-render all gallery example scripts to regenerate their ``_static/*.png``.

Run before ``zensical build`` so the docs site always ships thumbnails that
match the scripts currently checked in (rather than stale PNGs from a
previous edit). Wired into ``poe docs_build`` (see ``pyproject.toml``):

    uv run --group docs python docs/tutorials/gallery/_render.py
    uv run --group docs zensical build --clean

Each gallery script (``fitting.py``, ``3d_fitting.py``, ``multi_dataset_1d.py``,
``multi_dataset_2d.py``, ``shared_params.py``, ``varpro_vs_lm.py``,
``confidence_intervals.py``, ``spectrafit_vs_lmfit_moderate.py``,
``spectrafit_vs_lmfit_complex.py``, ``fixed_params.py``, ``weighted_fitting.py``,
``bounded_fitting.py``, ``robust_fitting.py``, ``global_optimizer.py``,
``failed_fit.py``, ``misspecified_model.py``) is a
standalone, runnable example guarded by
``if __name__ == "__main__":`` for its plotting/``savefig`` step, and
each already writes to ``docs/tutorials/gallery/_static/<name>.png`` via the
shared ``_plotting.savefig`` helper. Rather than importing and refactoring
each script to expose a common entry function (invasive: two of the five run
top-level fit/print code unconditionally, only guarding the plot), this
just re-executes each script the same way a contributor would from the
command line: ``python <script>.py``, run as a subprocess with this
directory as the working directory so the scripts' own
``from _plotting import ...`` sibling import resolves.

:func:`render_all` runs each script TWICE — once with no theme override
(light; writes the full-size PNG above plus a ``<name>-thumb-light.png``)
and once with ``SPECTRAFIT_GALLERY_THEME=dark`` (writes only
``<name>-thumb-dark.png``) — see ``_plotting.py`` for why this needs a
second subprocess rather than an in-process repaint. The gallery index
(``index.md``) swaps between the two thumbnails via CSS, the same
``[data-md-color-scheme]`` pattern ``docs/stylesheets/pages/hero.css``
already uses for the homepage hero art; tutorial detail pages are
unaffected and keep embedding the full-size light PNG only.

``_snippets/stacked_slices.py`` is a different contract: its own docstring
calls it a "standalone runnable script (no plotting)", and it is included
verbatim into ``3d_fitting.md`` via an ``--8<--`` snippet include rather than
a gallery card. It has top-level code (no ``__main__`` guard) and writes no
PNG, so it cannot go through :func:`render_all`'s "ran, then assert the PNG
landed" contract. :func:`run_snippets` runs it the same way -- a subprocess
with this directory as ``cwd`` so ``spectrafit_core`` still resolves via
``PYTHON_SRC`` -- but only asserts a zero exit, which is the only honest
claim: that the published script still runs.

    Each script is re-executed as a fresh subprocess under two different
    values of ``SPECTRAFIT_GALLERY_THEME`` (see ``_plotting.py``):

    1. Unset (light, the original/default pass) — writes the full-size
       ``<name>.png`` every tutorial detail page embeds, plus a
       ``<name>-thumb-light.png`` derived from it for the gallery index.
    2. ``"dark"`` — writes only ``<name>-thumb-dark.png``, the dark half of
       the gallery index's light/dark swap (mirrors
       ``.sf-hero__media-img--light/--dark`` in
       ``docs/stylesheets/pages/hero.css``).

    A second full subprocess run (rather than re-rendering the same figure
    object in-process) is what lets each script's own hardcoded colors
    (`MUTED_COLOR`, imported per-script) and every rcParams-driven default
    (ticks, spines, grid, legend text, figure/axes background) pick up the
    right theme — nothing here repaints an already-drawn artist after the
    fact.

    Raises:
        subprocess.CalledProcessError: if any script exits non-zero.
        FileNotFoundError: if an expected PNG is missing after its pass.
